# Omnivore Pack for Coda

Omnivore is a free and open-source read-it-later solution. Save articles for offline reading through the web app, iOS app, or browser extension. Label, highlight, and annotate them, and pick up where you left off -- Omnivore will save your place.

And now you can import your articles and highlights into [Coda](https://coda.io) for easy management and reference.

Please note that while Omnivore is self-hostable, this Pack is made for the hosted version at <https://omnivore.app>. The source code is freely available if you'd like to make a custom version of the Pack for yourself.

I'm not involved in the development of Omnivore, just a happy user. Please find the original project at <https://github.com/omnivore-app/omnivore>.
